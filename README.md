# BetterTeleport
This plugin gives your players a funny way for teleportation.\
The aim of this plugin is to help your non-donor players to save more than 1 home.\
Most servers allow donors to save a lot of homes, however this help your players to save locations for a price.\
 \
This can be used for **RPG** servers too.
